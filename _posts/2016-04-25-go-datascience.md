There is a lot of hype around Data Science/Engineering and there is a lot of hype around Golang. 
However, there has not been a lot of hype around using Go for Data Science/Engineering. 
In this meetup, Daniel Whitenack will discuss reasons for this, the huge value that 
Go could provide in data science/engineering, major Go-based efforts in the data world, 
and how you can get you can get involved and/or get your feet wet doing data science with Go. 

Daniel will also be presenting at [GopherCon 2016](https://gophercon.com/)
