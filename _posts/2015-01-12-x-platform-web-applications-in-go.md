Go is an amazing, multi-purpose language with abilities to compile applications 
for multiple platforms. Popular use cases include building high performance API's, 
CLI and devops tools. Go also provides great capabilities to build and distribute 
web applications that could run with no external dependencies on multiple platforms, 
such as OSX, Linux and Windows.
